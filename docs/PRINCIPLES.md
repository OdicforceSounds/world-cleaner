>> Videos: 

The concept of using videos is <b>against</b> everything I wish to anyone, while videos can be used for good or evil, as they complete all non-visual descriptions. 
I really prefer this rate system applied in any level of society as a way to motivate positive actions. While, when we work, we exchange Valued actions. 

1. Videos Stream can only be used by Companies to accomplish community challenges. 
2. Videos Stream can only be used by Citizen who aims to report a moment, where someone needs help. 

- Videos are reported directly to Government public services, with Citizen GPS + Video Visualization. 

> If government Public Services approve that report, Citizen gains one Point to HCP. 

> If government Public Service solve the problem reported, employees which work on it, gain one Point.   

> At classroom students gain one Point each Time shows Improvements and knowledge, logic, creativity, etc... Everything that have value.

- Students should know how to cultivate Plants, Care Animals, and Deal with Persons, to Cook, Clean, Fix...
- Control him/her Self. Martials arts are Awesome. You may be the best one to show those moves. 
- You have the Right to Hit anyone without Touching anyone. (Included in Our Eternal License)
