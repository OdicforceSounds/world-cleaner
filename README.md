	1. If X ApprovedRate +1 for User and AssociatedCompany
	2. If X DeniedRate +0 (no negative points) >> Is always negative when we fail << Keep it as a Lesson
	- Step-3: Start again Step-1

8. Points are Coins if: (we don't need to code a new blockchain) > Any blockchain can associate it self to 1 single point)
